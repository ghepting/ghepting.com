      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        I am a veteran web software engineer that has worked on a wide array of systems and technology stacks over my career. I've worked on systems built on AWS as well as GCP and using modern tech stacks with Node.js, Ruby on Rails, React, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about and always strive for building a remarkable user experience. I am highly customer focused and enjoy wearing the product manager hat with the systems I build and maintain, always looking for new ideas and features to solve more problems and optimize operational or manual processes.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over my career, I have built custom CMS solutions, interactive and dynamic frontend applications/experiences, ecommerce systems, marketing and publication web sites, implemented and extended analytics libraries, created multiple CSS frameworks, both open-source and internal enterprise UI systems, and more.

      Starting as a senior frontend engineer for the Brand team at Square (now Block, Inc.), I progressed deeper and deeper into server and distributed systems architecture, creating platforms that serve a diverse array of engineering teams as well as end users. I have worked with countless third-party/SaaS APIs to build custom software solutions ranging from headless CMS platforms like Contentful, to notification systems with messaging platforms such as Slack, translation request/fulfillment automation systems with internal systems, authentication and access control systems, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
      After just shy of 10 years with Block, I recently joined Contentful as a Senior Staff Software Engineer and helped build a new product development organization for the Ecosystem product line here in the United States. I currently lead the Developer Experience team here at Contentful that focuses on the tools our customers use such as client libraries and open-source packages & toolkits, the platform's extensibility aspects, such as the App Framework, and integration capabilities such as Webhooks.
